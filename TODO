TODO List:

-scale input image in test_matches.py at different and see how accraute it is
      - instead of passing a single-resoution image to SiLK, create multiple scaled versions of each image
      - for each image run silk on all sclaes and collect keypoints/descriptors
      - run it through variations of the second image ie. img0 is base img1 is img0 but skewed
      - if more time train it in this manner?/ run it on other datasets?
-write out report ~7 pages
- create slideshow
- github needs docmentation of method/code/readme
- judge by accuracy, time, number of keypoints, error
    - run it on rotated image, translated image, chamfer (geometric shape) image
